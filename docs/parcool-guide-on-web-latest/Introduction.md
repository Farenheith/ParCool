### *Welcome to ParCool Project!*

This mod is a *Minecraft Forge / NeoForge* mod for more **Cool** actions like **Parkour**.  
Some actions are actually techniques of parkour.

Also you can read in-game guidebook "*ParCool Guide*" by installing *Patchouli* mod.

Now you become a parkour-player. Let's run around the Minecraft World!

If you are a beginner of this mod, I recommend to read [overview](overview.md)!
