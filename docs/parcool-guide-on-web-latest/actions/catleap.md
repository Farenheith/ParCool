# Catleap

**Cat Leap** is a skill used to jump and cling to top of walls, fence or etc.
This is said to be one of basic skills of parkour.

Traceurs absorb an impact of landing with movement of legs.

Contrary to its name, this is actually a skill for *landing* on wall, not a technique of *jumping*.

In this mod, this is implemented as a long jump having wall landing animation. Please careful with the cool time.

I recommend also using [Cling To Cliff](cling_to_cliff.md).
