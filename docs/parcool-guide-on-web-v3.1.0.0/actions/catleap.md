# Cat Leap

**Cat Leap** is a skill used to jump and cling to top of walls,fence or etc.
This is said to be one of basic skills of parkour.

Traceurs absorb an impact of landing with movement of legs.

In this mod, this is implemented as a long jump. Please careful with the cool time.

### How to use

1. Do [Fast Run](fast_run.md).
2. Sneak quickly.
3. Cancel sneaking quickly.

I recommend also using [Cling To Cliff](cling_to_cliff.md).
