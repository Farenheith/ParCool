# Breakfall

---

**Breakfall**s are skills to protect us from impact of landing.

By this mod, you can do *Roll* and *Safety Tap*.

---

## Roll

**Roll** is one of the Breakfalls. It changes an impact of landing into energy of rolling.

This is sometimes misunderstood, but the *Roll* of parkour is landing technique, so ParCool's roll is also used only
when you land.

### How to use

- Land while you press forward or backward movement key and Breakfall Key

---

## Safety Tap

**Safety Tap** is one of the Breakfalls. It absorbs an impact by bending your legs.

...By the way how can Steve bend his legs?

### How to use

- Land while you press Breakfall Key
