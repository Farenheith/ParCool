# ParCool MOD

**Welcome to this project!**

*ParCool* is a mod of Minecraft, for more *Cool* Actions like *Parkour*.  
It's inspired by [SmartMoving](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/smart-moving). That was a very great mod.

Players can do more actions such as...

+ Grabbing Cliffs
+ Running Faster
+ Roll
+ Backflip
+ WallJump
+ CatLeap  
  etc

If it made you traceurs or traceuses ; parkour practitioners, I couldn't be happier!!

This project is always ready to accept your contribution.
